# sql_challenge
The object of this assignment was to create a database in sql and the create 6 tables within said database to import 6 seperate csv's into. Once this was done or before this was done we had to create a Entity Relationship Diagram of how these different csv would collaborate. After creating this we needed to answer the given questions and use querries to call upon the answers from the various csv files that now resided in our database.

Completion process I would first attempt to find each of these value using my memory, then i would lookinto the class notes and activities as a way to find out my next course of action when i was lost. After doing these steps i would consult ChatGPT to find out where i went wrong and would use its assitance to correct the code as well as explain its proccess to me so i could understand for the future how to fulfill these tasks without aid.

Abdo provided me with assistance when the above steps all failed.
